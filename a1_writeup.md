# Assignment 1 - Write UP
Aaron Mata's Writeup
## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

It looks like Python is a bit easier to use. As a guy who has only used Java until now, I think it is better to just initialize a variable without having to write String, double, boolean, int. Thing is I will still need a bit more practice to gain a flow state with Python. 

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

I used AI to learn more about the program. A highlight could be learning about del list[]. I learned some shortcuts and really helpful built-in functions. Although an important thing I learned was using my Java knowledge to think the same way or similarly while using Python. 

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

Some concepts were just being solved by AI telling me what built-in functions to use, I don't think I really struggled a lot.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?

AI is really helpful when being used productively. It makes one actually learn new concepts instead of just asking for the answers. 
I like to think that if you are asking an AI for answers, you are not cheating on the assignment, but on yourself.
This assignment will most likely make me resort a bit on AI to study on other classes.
