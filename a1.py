MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
[I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have some experience with coding but only with Java, since I took AP Computer Science A sophomore year (2 years ago). Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover: Variables and basic data types Conditionals (if/elif/else) Loops (for and while) Functions Basic list operations]

PROBLEM 1: [Problem Title/Description]
[Copy the complete problem description from your AI assistant]

Example:
Problem: Write a function called 'is_even' that takes an integer and returns 
True if the number is even, False if it's odd.

Example inputs/outputs:
- is_even(4) should return True
- is_even(7) should return False
